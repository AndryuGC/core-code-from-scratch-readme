## Algorithms - Week 1

### *Let's make Pizza*
1. Buy the ingredients
2. Knead the dough
3. Do the circular form
4. Put all the ingredients in the pizza
5. Enter in the oven
6. Bake for 15 minutes
7. Eat your pizza

### *Hot N Cold 🤒 🧊 🔥*
1. Enter the Celsius number
2. Do the operation
3. Multiply your number by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32.
4. And that's it, Print your result
5. End

### *Some geometry 📐*
1. Ask who figure needs
2. The formula of Cube is:   
  2.1 We know that the volume of a cube is (Area*Length)     
  2.2 So, for example the Area was base*high and the result for this operation multiply and side  
  2.3 Print the volume form that is (side*side*side) side^3  
3. The formula for a Pyramid is:  
  3.1 Ask for the base, width and height of the pyramid    
  3.2 We know that the volume of a pyramid is (1/3 x base length x base width x height)    
  3.3 Enter the number into the formula    
  3.4 Print the result  
4. The formula for a sphere is:  
  4.1 Ask the radius of the sphere  
  4.2 We know the volume of sphere (4/3 πr³)  
  4.3 Put the radius in the form changing the **r**  
  4.4 Print the result   
  
  ### *Numbers 📈*  
  1. Ask the number that need to verify  
  2. if the number is divided by 2 and is not a decimal, the number is even  
  3. Print "The number is even"  
  4. Also if the number is divided by 2 and is a decimal  
  5. Print "the number is odd"
  
  ### *How old are you 👴*
  1. Ask the date and the year of the person born 
  2. So for this operation, uses actual date - birthday date of the person  
  3. And Print the result that is the age.
  
  ### *Find the treasure 👑*  
  1. As know that all the chest have a message, we know that at least one has a treasure in it and all the messages are lie.  
  2. In the case that all the messages are lie, we know that:  
    2.1 The middle chest not has a treasure.  
    2.2 All these chests don't have treasures in them.  
    2.3 Not only one of these chests has treasures.  
  3. So for this contractions we know that the middle chest don't have a treasure, all the chesta don´t have and not only one have a chest  
  4. So in the first instructions said that at least one has a treasure, so using the contractions know that the treasures are in the chest A and C.
  
  ## Pseudocode - Week 2  
  
  ### *Logic problem*
  So we know that The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.  

  Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".  
  Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".  
  Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".  
  Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".  
  Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".  

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?  

  So if Alice study, the sentence is contradicted because she said that Nobody study math including she
  In another like Charlie, Dan and Eva said that x numbers > 1 people study math, in the case that anyone tell the true, is another contradiction because in the other case said another numbers of people so this is not posible  
  So the only person that said the true is Bob because he said that only one study and if he study, hes statement is correct.  
  
  ### *Which comes first, cereal or milk?*  
    1. Grab a Bowl  
    2. Take your favorite cereal and milk  
    2.1 Put first the milk and then the cereal  
    2.2 Also put the cereal first and then the milk  
    3. Enjoy your cereal
